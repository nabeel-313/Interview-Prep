Q1 - Given a DataFrame with customer transactions, identify all customers who have increased their monthly spending by at least 20% compared to their 6 month average.
Sample Data: Assume a DataFrame transactions with columns ['CustomerID', 'TransactionDate', 'Amount'].

Q2 - From the DataFrame of transactions, identify all users who have had at least three transactions per month for the last six months.
Sample Data: Assume a DataFrame transactions with columns ['UserID', 'TransactionDate', 'Amount'].

Q3 - Given sales data, group by month and product category. For each group, identify the product with the highest sale and return a DataFrame with these products and their sales figures.
Sample Data: Assume a DataFrame sales_data with columns ['Date', 'Category', 'Product', 'Sales'].

Q4 - Create a pivot table from a sales dataset that shows the sum of sales and the average discount rate by month and salesperson.
Sample Data: Assume a DataFrame sales with columns ['Salesperson', 'Date', 'Sales', 'DiscountRate'].

Q5 - Aggregate a dataset by calculating the mean of a column, excluding the top and bottom 5% of the data.
Sample Data: Assume a DataFrame performance_data with columns ['EmployeeID', 'Score'].
