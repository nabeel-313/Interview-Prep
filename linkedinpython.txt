Keep Learning 😊!!

It took me 3 hours to debug this data error when building a deep learning model 🧩

Deep learning models may fail to converge due to various reasons. Some causes are obvious and common, and therefore, quickly rectifiable, like:
- too high/low learning rate
- no data normalization
- no batch normalization, etc.

But the problem arises when the cause isn’t that apparent. Therefore, it may take some serious time to debug if you are unaware of them.

One such data-related mistake, which can seriously hurt your deep learning model is label ordering.

Consider a classification dataset. We train two different neural networks using mini-batch gradient descent:
- Version 1: The dataset is ordered by labels.
- Version 2: The dataset is shuffled by labels.

The image below depicts their epoch-by-epoch performance.
- The left model was trained on label-ordered data
- The right model was trained on the shuffled dataset.

The model receiving a label-ordered dataset miserably fails to converge.

Why does that happen?

Now, if you think about it, overall, both models received the same data. Yet, the order in which the data was fed to these models totally determined their performance.

I vividly remember facing this issue during my very early days in ML.

At that time, it never occurred to me that ordering may influence the model performance. My rationale was that the whole data would always be the same regardless of the ordering.

But later, I realized that this point will only be valid in batch gradient descent, i.e., when the model updates its weights for the entire data in one go.

But in mini-batch gradient descent, the weights are updated after every mini-batch.

Thus, the weight update on a subsequent mini-batch depends on the previous mini-batches.

Thus, in label-ordered data, mini-batch gradient descent leads the model to learn patterns specific to the class it excessively saw early on in training.

Note: Of course, the idea of shuffling is not valid for time-series datasets as their temporal structure is important.

Before I end, one thing that you must ALWAYS remember when training neural networks is that these models can proficiently learn entirely non-existing patterns about your dataset. So never give them any chance to do so.

Taking specifically about label ordering, the good thing is that if you happen to use, say, PyTorch DataLoader, you are safe.

This is because it already implements shuffling. But if you have a custom implementation, ensure that you are not making any such error.

🚀 Exploring Feature Scaling 📊

💡Explain Feature scaling?

👩‍💼 Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range. It is performed during the data pre-processing. 

Here's a brief explanation of common feature scaling techniques:

a). Standardization:

-Rescales features so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
-Less sensitive to outliers compared to other methods.

b). Min-max scaling (Normalization):

-scales all the data features in the range [0, 1] or else in the range [-1, 1] if there are negative values in the dataset. 

c) Robust scaling:

-Similar to standardization but uses the median and interquartile range instead of the mean and standard deviation.
- More robust to outliers compared to standardization.

d). Unit vector scaling:

- Scales features so that the Euclidean norm (L2 norm) is 1.
- Ensures that the vector representing each sample has a magnitude of 1.

e). Mean normalization:

- Scales features so that they have a mean of 0 and a range typically between -1 and 1.

f). Quantile transformation:

-transforms the features to follow a uniform or a normal distribution.

g). Power transformation:

- Applies a power transformation to make the data more Gaussian-like.
- It include the Box-Cox transformation and Yeo-Johnson transformation.

h). Log transformation:

- Applies a logarithmic transformation to the data.
- Useful for handling skewed distributions and making the data more symmetrical.

i). Rank transformation:

- Replaces the original values with their rank in the sorted array.
- Useful for non-parametric statistical tests or algorithms that are sensitive to outliers.

j ). Sigmoid normalization:

- Applies a sigmoid function to the data to squash extreme values.
- Useful for neural networks and other models that benefit from bounded inputs.
