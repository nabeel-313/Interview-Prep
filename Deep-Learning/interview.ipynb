    "    Start Simple: For most tasks, starting with Adam is a good choice due to its ease of use and robustness across different tasks.\n",
    "    Experiment with SGD Variants: For image classification tasks or when you have large datasets, SGD with momentum or NAG might offer better generalization.\n",
    "    Use Adagrad for Sparse Data: If you're dealing with natural language processing or other tasks involving sparse features, Adagrad or RMSprop can be effective.\n",
    "    Consider AdamW for Regularization: When regularization is a concern, or you're training large-scale models like transformers, AdamW is often preferred.\n",
    "    Tune Hyperparameters: Regardless of the optimizer, tuning the learning rate and other hyperparameters is crucial for achieving optimal performance.\n",

    "Choosing the right optimizer depends on the specific task, the nature of the data, and the model architecture. It's often beneficial to experiment with a few optimizers and observe \n",
