    "Certainly! Here are the interview questions related to file handling, along with their answers:\n",
    "1. What are the different modes of opening a file in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In Python, files can be opened in different modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    'r': Read Mode - Opens a file for reading. Raises an error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "    'w': Write Mode - Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist, or truncates the file if it does.\n",
    "    'a': Append Mode - Opens a file for appending. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "    'x': Exclusive Creation Mode - Creates a new file and opens it for writing. Raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "    'b': Binary Mode - Used in conjunction with other modes to open the file in binary mode (e.g., 'rb', 'wb').\n",
    "    't': Text Mode - Used in conjunction with other modes to open the file in text mode (default mode, e.g., 'rt').\n",
